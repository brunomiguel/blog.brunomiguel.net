  <section class="post-content"><p>A few days ago, I decided to give <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> another try. I&rsquo;ve previously attempted to use this text-editor / operating system — probably about 10 years ago or maybe a bit more — but never got the hang of it.</p>
<p>A few years after my first try at Emacs, I discovered Markdown. Since then, I&rsquo;ve used text editors with a GUI to write in this markup language. That was until two years ago when I encountered a Vim mode for Markdown and adapted it to my specific needs. It has been one of my main tools to write, but I don&rsquo;t really like the Vim keybindings.</p>
<p>After a bit of pondering, I thought about giving Emacs another go, mainly because the shortcuts are similar to the ones used by Tmux and I felt this would make my adaptation to the editor easier. But to do that, I would need to read about this software, given its complexity. That&rsquo;s how I got to an amazing reading resource: <a href="https://tuhdo.github.io/emacs-tutor.html">&ldquo;Emacs Mini Manual (PART 1) - THE BASICS&rdquo;</a>. If you want to learn how to use Emacs, give it a go; it&rsquo;s really useful.</p>
<p>One thing about Emacs is that it feels bare-bone when compared to some editors. This is not true, of course, but for a newbie like me, it might as well be because most of the options are “hidden” and you need to know how to get to them.</p>
<p>After reading the “Emacs Mini Manual” and some other resources sent to my by folks at Twitter and at <a href="https://fosshost.org/">Fosshost&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/#fosshost">IRC channel</a>, I decided to try an Emacs distribution to help me use this software. That&rsquo;s how I got to <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prelude is an enhanced Emacs 25.1+ distribution that should make your experience with Emacs both more pleasant and more powerful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it really does. It has some themes, avoiding the eye-hurting default white background, and includes several plugins to ease your life. Also, you can configure it as you like, just like vanilla Emacs.</p>
<p>To try this distribution, I decided to write this blog post after setting it up. So far, so good.</p>
<p>PS: It&rsquo;s almost time for <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/">EmacsConf</a>.</p>
