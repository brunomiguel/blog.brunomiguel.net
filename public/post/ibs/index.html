  <section class="post-content"><p>About 7 or 8 years ago, I was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs/"><em>IBS</em></a>. If you don&rsquo;t know what it is, it stands for <em>Irritable Bowel Syndrome</em> and it&rsquo;s a functional gastrointestinal disorder that&rsquo;s estimated to affect 10% to 15% of the world population.</p>
<p>In most cases, as far as I know, a simple change in diet allows one to keep the symptoms mostly at bay and have a normal life. For some unlucky few, it will fuck up their life in ways they can&rsquo;t imagine. And I don&rsquo;t mean quitting coffee like I had to do (I had an gigantic headache during the first two weeks after quitting) or develop a lactose intolerance (like I also did) that forced me to exclude even more food from my diet. I mean things like wanting to go out with your girlfriend and/or friends but choosing to stay at home because your bowl feels a little strange and that&rsquo;s always a sign that acute pain or some other symptom is just around the corner. Or feeling outright tired for no reason other than being in pain.</p>
<p>The negative effect is not just in your social life. Your work will be affected and no employer wants to deal with that. If you&rsquo;re unlucky and have severe and frequent symptoms, you&rsquo;ll probably not be able to keep a job for too long, even if you work harder than anyone else.</p>
<p>But you know what&rsquo;s the worst part? Those closest to you patronizing or antagonizing your pain. I&rsquo;ve lost count of the times someone told me to take a pill when I&rsquo;m in acute pain (most of the times, only strong painkillers work and sadly not that much) or to go to the bathroom. I wish it was that easy&hellip;</p>
<p>This causes stress. A lot of stress. And stress in one trigger for <em>IBS</em>. So, sometimes, the people closest to you make you and your life worst. If you happen to have someone like this in your life, cut him/her off. Your bowel and overall health will thank you.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help that most doctors either don&rsquo;t know a thing about <em>IBS</em> or only know outdated and usually incorrect information. I&rsquo;m including here so-called gastroenterologists . I&rsquo;ve met a few that know way less than I do about this.</p>
<p>If all of this seems exacerbated to you, let me tell you: I&rsquo;m with a sick leave, tried a &lsquo;but load&rsquo; of different medications, fasting for two days so I could give my lower intestine some rest, did several exams (that, like always, show nothing wrong, a normal thing with <em>IBS</em>), and it&rsquo;s 06:41am (at the time of writing) and I&rsquo;m awake again, with pain, trying to write this for the last three or four hours in an attempt to distract me a bit from the cramps.</p>
<p>Yay for the shitshow that is <em>IBS</em>.</p>
