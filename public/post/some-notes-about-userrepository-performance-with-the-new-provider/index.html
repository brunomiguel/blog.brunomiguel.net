  <title>Some notes about userrepository performance with the new provider - .blog</title>

  
  
  <meta name="description" content="In the previous post, I wrote about how I changed the virtual machine provider from Scaleway to Hetzner. In the days following the transition, I timed how much it took to build all the packages and sync them to the webserver, so I could compare the new provider with the previous one.
The specs are very similar: 4 vCPUs and 8GB of RAM. There is one difference, however: with Scaleway, the vCPUs were some Intel low-end ones (although they&rsquo;ve upgraded to AMD EPYC very recently) and with Hetzer they are AMD EPYC." />

  <section class="post-content"><p>In the previous post, I wrote about how I changed the virtual machine provider from <em>Scaleway</em> to <em>Hetzner</em>. In the days following the transition, I timed how much it took to build all the packages and sync them to the webserver, so I could compare the new provider with the previous one.</p>
<p>The specs are very similar: 4 <em>vCPUs</em> and 8GB of <em>RAM</em>. There is one difference, however: with <em>Scaleway</em>, the <em>vCPUs</em> were some <em>Intel</em> low-end ones (although they&rsquo;ve upgraded to <em>AMD EPYC</em> very recently) and with <em>Hetzer</em> they are <em>AMD EPYC</em>. And what a difference this makes.</p>
<p>Previously, 250 and something packages took almost 5 hours to complete the build and sync them to the webserver. Now, it takes around 4 hours and 12 minutes to build and sync 328 packages. That&rsquo;s a huge difference.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only been using <em>Hetzer</em> for <em><a href="https://userrepository.eu">userrepository</a></em> for about a week, but so far it feels like an improvement. But I&rsquo;ve yet to test the network performance.</p>
