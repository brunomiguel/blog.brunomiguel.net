<p>In the last 5 months or so (I&rsquo;m really bad with dates), I&rsquo;ve been improving the first <strong>tactic</strong> I built for <strong><em>Football Manager 2019</em></strong>. This was done using the latest official game update at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Before this, I was using a tactic made by some user from fmscout.com. I can&rsquo;t really recall which was but I had good results, yet would notice some instability in the performance every few games even against weaker adversaries. Playing with <em>Benfica</em>, I would be league champion but with one or two defeats, and a few ties. Of course, winning the <em>Champions League</em> would be a really hard thing to accomplish.</p>
<p>I wanted to change that and, at the same time, build my first <em>FM2019</em> tactic. So I began building it, tweaking and tweaking after every game until I could find a tactic that would be <strong>good at attacking and defending</strong>, and would also <strong>act as a positional block in both stages of the game</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The secret to this was making the right and left defenders work as defensive midfielders when the team is attacking.</strong> This allows the central midfielders to focus more on attacking, while also allowing this defenders to enter the area from time to time to score some goals.</p>
<p>With this and some other specificities to this tactic, I get 20+ shots against 4 to 5 from the opposite team, even in away games. Of course, if you&rsquo;re playing, let&rsquo;s say, with <em>Benfica</em> against <em>Barcelona</em> in their own stadium, it will be a tough game but you&rsquo;ll most likely win.</p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind that this tactic doesn&rsquo;t make miracles.</strong> You&rsquo;ll most likely loose, even when playing at home, if your opponent is far better than you.</p>
