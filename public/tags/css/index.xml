      <description>I love AUR. Being able to use a simple PKGBUILD to install a software not available in the official Arch repositories is a blessing. Sadly, its user experience and looks need improvements to bring it to the 21st century.
One of the things that bug me the most is the microscopic font size. I almost need a telescope to read the text.
To fix it, and make it smoother on the eyes, I created a dark theme for AUR.</description>

      <title>Improved new night mode for Twitter</title>

      <description>I got the new, event and flex-based, Twitter design a few days ago and decided to try out the night mode. This was also influenced by some tweet a contact of mine published.
While not bad, I don&amp;rsquo;t like what I think is an exaggerated use of blue hues and shades. I find it even worse at night, due to the blue light stuff impacting our sleep. Even with a blue light filter, like the one from Plasma, it&amp;rsquo;s still too much blue.</description>
