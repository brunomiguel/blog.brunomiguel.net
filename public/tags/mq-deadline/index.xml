      <description>Today, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try and improve the boot time of my laptop, running EndeavourOS. There was no special reason for it other than &amp;ldquo;Why not?&amp;rdquo;.
The first thing I made was disabling or masking the following systemd services:
 systemd-resolved disabled tlp disabled NetworkManager-wait-online disabled lvm2-monitor masked org.cups.cupsd disabled packagekit masked bluetooth disabled (I rarely use the laptop&amp;rsquo;s bluetooth) blueman-mechanism disabled  With this, I was able to save a few milliseconds and decrease the enabled systemd units to 15, but the impact was negligible.</description>
