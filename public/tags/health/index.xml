      <description>About 7 or 8 years ago, I was diagnosed with IBS. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is, it stands for Irritable Bowel Syndrome and it&amp;rsquo;s a functional gastrointestinal disorder that&amp;rsquo;s estimated to affect 10% to 15% of the world population.
In most cases, as far as I know, a simple change in diet allows one to keep the symptoms mostly at bay and have a normal life. For some unlucky few, it will fuck up their life in ways they can&amp;rsquo;t imagine.</description>
