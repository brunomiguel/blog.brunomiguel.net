      <description>After a small forced hiatus, userrepository.eu is back. The Covid-19 pandemic made a hit in my income and the wife&amp;rsquo;s income, so I had to temporarily suspend non-priority expenses. During this period, I had time to consider a few things about the future of the project and decided to change the provider from Scaleway to Hetzner, mostly because the Arch image they&amp;rsquo;re using is essentially abandonware.
If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably know that Arch Linux changed the default package compression to ZSTD.</description>
