      <description>Hello, folks. It has been a while since I last wrote about my AUR-based Arch Linux repository. To be precise, four months and twelve days.
A lot has happened since then. One of the main changes was the removal of several packages no longer present in AUR or really outdated. Some examples are peafox, marp and gimp-dbp.
Another important change was the addition of several new packages, as usual. If I find it may be useful for someone, I add it.</description>

      <title>Metapackage for a personal installation of Arch Linux and Arch-based distributions</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Arch or Arch-based distributions for over a year now. In this time testing a few of them, I&amp;rsquo;ve always lacked a simple and logical way of installing the same &amp;ldquo;essential&amp;rdquo; software. To tackle this, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a metapackage with all this software and this is what I&amp;rsquo;ve got so far:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a simple but powerful solution for managing my dotfiles, either the ones on my personal computer or the ones I use on virtual machines. After taking a look at a few options, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll give dotdrop a try and publish a new post as soon as I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve evaluated it enough.</description>

      <title>How-to customize the Bash prompt</title>

      <description>In order to adapt a bit more my Debian Stable installation to my workflow, I&amp;rsquo;ve been tweaking the bash prompt. Simplicity and small line width are key here, because I often have tmux running with several panes in the same window and small panes with large one-liner prompts suck a lot! Everything feels crammed and hard to read. Just take a look at the image below to get an idea.</description>
