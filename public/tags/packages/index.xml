      <description>Since the 24th of January, the date of the last blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ve added a shitload of new packages to userrepository.eu. Some highlights are sonobus, media-downloader-git, baru, dotgit, timeshift, filmulator and tramp.
Expect more packages, as I&amp;rsquo;m adding new ones frequently. The focus on new packages will probably be scientific tools and maybe a kernel. With that, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have to increase the full build frequency from 8h to at least 9 hours.</description>

      <description>Lately, the repository has been taking +10 hours to compile all the packages. I think that&amp;rsquo;s a lot for a little more than 250 packages, most of them small utilities and/or _-bin_ files from AUR, built in a DEV1-L (4 cores, 8 Gb RAM) virtual machine from Scaleway.
After investigating the matter, I found out that 12 of the packages took four hours and sixteen minutes to build.

      <title>I&#39;ve built a Manjaro repository</title>

      <description>Due to my own dumbness (I mistakenly deleted my Ubuntu partition), I installed Manjaro, using the Manjaro Architect release, on my laptop. I&amp;rsquo;d been thinking about doing it for a while and finally made it because I was too stupid to read the instructions from cfdisk. The shit you create yourself because you&amp;rsquo;re in a hurryâ€¦
Anyway, after installing Manjaro, I started reading a bit about this distro packaging and how I could leverage AUR and binary packages.</description>
