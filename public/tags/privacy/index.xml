      <description>Google Chrome is such a privacy hell that it has become it&amp;rsquo;s own hell in the japanese folklore. You&amp;rsquo;re better off with Firefox and you get better performance. But if you really want Chrome, Ungoogled Chromium is based on the previous (technically, it&amp;rsquo;s based on Chromium) with some bits removed for added privacy.</description>

      <description>Criptex is a new email client with a strong focus on the user&amp;rsquo;s privacy and data security, released by an independent company with the same name. The app stores all the emails on the device(s) it&amp;rsquo;s used, encrypted with the Signal Protocol, instead of storing them in their servers. This gives user&amp;rsquo;s total control over their data.
This software is open source and available for Android, iOS and macOS. Linux and Windows releases will be available soon.</description>
