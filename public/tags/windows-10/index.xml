      <description>Yesterday, I had to reinstall Windows 10 on a computer because the owner was complaining it was too slow. After a successful, albeit slow, reinstall, I had to change the language.
This computer had Windows in English and the owner wanted it in European Portuguese. So, after reinstalling the OS, I selected the European Portuguese language in the system options (or whatever it is called) and chose the pt-PT langpack.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I bought a Lenovo Ideapad 320-15AST. I had a budget of €400 and, after browsing a few stores for a couple of hours, I found this one for a bit less than €350.
At the hardware level, the computer has reasonable specs. They are (retrieved from inxi):
CPU: AMD A9-9420 dual core (1397MHz/3000MHz | boost: 3600MHz) GPU: AMD Radeon R7 M260/M265 HDD: 1000.2GB 5400RPM RAM: 8GB DDR4 This is the first time I’m buying Lenovo.</description>
