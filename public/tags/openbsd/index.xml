      <description>A few days ago I installed Debian Stable. I&amp;rsquo;d been using Sparky Linux, which is based on Debian Testing, and was happy with it. The tools it integrates make the life of a desktop user easier when managing the system, I had no issues with it and had a bunch of software available in the repositories.
Well, since Sparky is based on Debian, the &amp;ldquo;bunch of software available in the repositories&amp;rdquo; part was a given from the start.</description>
