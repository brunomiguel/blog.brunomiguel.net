      <description>Since my last blog post about Emacs (and the last post I published here), I&amp;rsquo;ve tested some Starter Kits. All of them were genuinely nice and came with a lot of tools included, but most of these tools were things I didn&amp;rsquo;t need.
Not a long time after that, I found a Reddit post about nano-emacs. Unlike the other Starter Kits, this one is plain and incredibly beautiful. It even got better recently with the addition of the writer-mode minor mode for org-mode, as you can see in the featured image on this post.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, I decided to give Emacs another try. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously attempted to use this text-editor / operating system — probably about 10 years ago or maybe a bit more — but never got the hang of it.
A few years after my first try at Emacs, I discovered Markdown. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve used text editors with a GUI to write in this markup language. That was until two years ago when I encountered a Vim mode for Markdown and adapted it to my specific needs.</description>
