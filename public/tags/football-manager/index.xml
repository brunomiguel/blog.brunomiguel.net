      <description>In the last 5 months or so (I&amp;rsquo;m really bad with dates), I&amp;rsquo;ve been improving the first tactic I built for Football Manager 2019. This was done using the latest official game update at the time of writing.
Before this, I was using a tactic made by some user from fmscout.com. I can&amp;rsquo;t really recall which was but I had good results, yet would notice some instability in the performance every few games even against weaker adversaries.</description>
