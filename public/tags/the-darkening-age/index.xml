      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started reading The Darkening Age, a book by Catherine Nixey about the destruction Christianity brought to the other religions in its early days. This was a recommendation André Esteves made to me on Twitter and I&amp;rsquo;m glad he did it. I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished the prologue and was so blown by how it ends that I stopped reading it so I could publish this.
 Mere decapitation wasn’t enough. More blows fell, scalping Athena, striking the helmet from the goddess’s head, smashing it into pieces.</description>
