      <description>Step aside, Kepler, TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) is in town and ready to discover more exoplanets (planets outside of our solar system) and closer to &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo;.
From Engadget:
 TESS is a follow-up to Kepler, a spacecraft that has spent the last nine years searching for Earth-like exoplanets near Sun-like stars. Though it may be on its last legs, Kepler has already found 2,650 confirmed exoplanets and even more are expected to be discovered from the data it has collected.</description>
