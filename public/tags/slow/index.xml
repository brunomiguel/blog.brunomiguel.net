      <description>Yesterday, I had to reinstall Windows 10 on a computer because the owner was complaining it was too slow. After a successful, albeit slow, reinstall, I had to change the language.
This computer had Windows in English and the owner wanted it in European Portuguese. So, after reinstalling the OS, I selected the European Portuguese language in the system options (or whatever it is called) and chose the pt-PT langpack.</description>
