      <description>Hello, folks. It has been a while since I last wrote about my AUR-based Arch Linux repository. To be precise, four months and twelve days.
A lot has happened since then. One of the main changes was the removal of several packages no longer present in AUR or really outdated. Some examples are peafox, marp and gimp-dbp.
Another important change was the addition of several new packages, as usual. If I find it may be useful for someone, I add it.</description>
