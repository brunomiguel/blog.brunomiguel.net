A few days ago I installed _[Debian](https://debian.org) Stable_. I'd been using _[Sparky Linux](https://sparkylinux.org/)_, which is based on _Debian Testing_, and was happy with it. The tools it integrates make the life of a desktop user easier when managing the system, I had no issues with it and had a bunch of software available in the repositories.

Well, since _Sparky_ is based on _Debian_, the "bunch of software available in the repositories" part was a given from the start.

Although happy, I was looking for an operating system a bit more conservative in terms of stability and reliability. I'd been inspired very recently by the short [_OpenBSD_](https://openbsd.org) usage I had on a virtual machine and some readings about _BSD_ systems, so I thought _Debian Stable_ would be the best choice.

Here are my motives for choosing _Debian_ over, say, _CentOS_ or _Slackware_ or even a _BSD_ system:

- It's a _Linux_ kernel based operating system and I've been mostly using _Debian Testing_ or _Debian_\-based systems for over a decade, so I'm familiar with it;
- It prioritizes stability over the latest stable version of a software;
- It has a lot of software available;
- It has a very large community.

Almost a week went by and my fears of using older versions of any softwareÂ (motivated almost exclusively by a potential lack of some functionality) are gone. The system is really stable and I have almost all the tools I need in the repositories. I only needed to install a handfull of apps from external sources ([_deb-multimedia_](http://www.deb-multimedia.org/), _github_, _flatpak_ and _snap_) because they were not packaged in the distro's repositories.
