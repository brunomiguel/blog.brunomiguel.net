These are a few notes about _Opera_ and _Vivaldi_ web browser's when compared to _Firefox_, after using both for a week.

### The good

- sleek interface (both but I became more fond of _Opera_ in this regard)
- functionality (both)
- some sort of adblocker included (both)
- integrated _VPN_ in _Opera_ (although I have mixed feelings about this, since it's proprietary as far as I can tell)

### The bad

- resource usage bigger than _Firefox_ in my system (both)
- slower _than_ Firefox, using default configs (both)
- proprietary (both)

The following specs were used when testing both browsers:
