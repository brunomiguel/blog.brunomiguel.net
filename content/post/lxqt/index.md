In the last couple of months, I've been using _[LXQT](https://lxqt.org/)_ as an alternative to _Plasma Desktop_. Coupled with _[compton\_tryone](https://github.com/tryone144/compton)_ for the blur bling, a nice dark and transparent theme, and some _GTK_ and _Kvantum_ dark themes to match, it's actually a great desktop environment.
