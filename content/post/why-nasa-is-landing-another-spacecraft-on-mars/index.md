To get the _Biker Mice_ to _Earth_. That's true, _sheeple_, _NASA_ wants illegal aliens in our planet, so they can steal our jobs, rape our wives and all that crazy shit typically written by delusional right-wing folks.

Jokes apart, tune in the _[NASA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwMDvPCGeE0)_ [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwMDvPCGeE0) if you want to watch the landing.
