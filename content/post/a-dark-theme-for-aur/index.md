I love [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/). Being able to use a simple `PKGBUILD` to install a software not available in the official Arch repositories is a blessing. Sadly, its user experience and looks need improvements to bring it to the 21st century.

One of the things that bug me the most is the microscopic font size. I almost need a telescope to read the text.

To fix it, and make it smoother on the eyes, I created a dark theme for AUR. You'll need to install the Stylus browser addon in order to use it. The CSS code is available as a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/brunomiguel/6b71aaef5d670145cf2e2776c22c3b91). Just click [here](https://gist.github.com/brunomiguel/6b71aaef5d670145cf2e2776c22c3b91) to access the code.

Bare in mind, though, this is an alpha version. There might be things not yet stylized to match the rest of the elements. If you find an element with the original AUR look, leave a comment on the [Gist](https://gist.github.com/brunomiguel/6b71aaef5d670145cf2e2776c22c3b91) and I'll update it.
