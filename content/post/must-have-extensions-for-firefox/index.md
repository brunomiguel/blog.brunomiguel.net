I've been a _Firefox_ user since version 1.0, and the _Mozilla Suite_ before that. Shamefully, I also used the infamous _Internet Explorer_ long before that crap evolved to something close to a browser but not quite and still shitty.

During all my years with this browser, I've come to use a handful of extensions that I consider essential. The list has changed over the years and has taken many forms. The current one is as follow:

- [ublock origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-PT/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-PT/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/)
- [auto tab discard](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-PT/firefox/addon/auto-tab-discard/)
- [facebook container](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-PT/firefox/addon/facebook-container/)
- [share backported](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-PT/firefox/addon/share-backported/)
- [stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-PT/firefox/addon/styl-us/) (sadly, not all websites have readable font size)

The list is short but I consider all of them essential. Believe it or not, this is the almost complete list of extensions I have installed. I try not to use many of them due to the impact on the browser performance.

Do you consider other extensions essential? Feel free to share them in the comments.
