Read [_**The Autocracy App**_](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/10/25/facebook-autocracy-app/), published in _The New York Review of Books_, and draw your own conclusions. It's a long, but well worth, text about the impacts of _Facebook_ on our societies and the apparent inclination it has for favoring dictatorships and autocracies.  

It gave me the chills...
