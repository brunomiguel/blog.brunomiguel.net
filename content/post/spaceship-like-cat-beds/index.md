If we get a cat (we've talked about it one or two times), we'll have to get one of **[this](https://www.myzoostudio.com/pages/spaceship)** spaceship-like cat beds, from _Myzoo Studio_, eventually. Most likely a DIY one, because these ones are too expensive. **But they are so cool!** Even I would like a bed like this.
