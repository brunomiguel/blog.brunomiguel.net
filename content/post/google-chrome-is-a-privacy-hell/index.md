Google Chrome is such a [privacy](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/users-forcibly-being-logged-into-chrome-when-signing-into-a-google-service/) [hell](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/chrome-69-keeps-googles-cookies-after-you-clear-browser-data/) that it has become it's own hell in the [japanese folklore](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/japanese-hells/). You're better off with [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/pt-PT/firefox/) and you get better performance. But if you really want Chrome, [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) is based on the previous (technically, it's based on Chromium) with some bits removed for added privacy.
