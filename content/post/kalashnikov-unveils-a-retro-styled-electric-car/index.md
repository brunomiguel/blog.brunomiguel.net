Russian weapons manufacturer _Kalashnikov_ unveiled a line of electric and hybrid cars, buggies and motorcycles this week. One of those vehicles is a retro-styled concept car named _CV-1_, capable of running for 350 kilometers with a single charge and accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h in 6 seconds. And it doesn't look that bad.
