Yesterday, I had to reinstall _Windows 10_ on a computer because the owner was complaining it was too slow. After a successful, albeit slow, reinstall, I had to change the language.

This computer had _Windows_ in English and the owner wanted it in European Portuguese. So, after reinstalling the OS, I selected the European Portuguese language in the system options (or whatever it is called) and chose the pt-PT langpack.

So far, so good, I thought. Yet, the download took about 30 minutes to start and I was stumped. How could this be, if I have a 200Mb/100Mb fiber connection?! Even an upgrade from _Debian Stable_ to _Debian Testing_ takes less time (downloading and installing the packages). I guess thatÂ _Windows Update_ still works at the speed of a snail.
