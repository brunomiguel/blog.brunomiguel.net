More than a month has passed since I switched from Firefox to [Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/) to regain some online privacy. I've had a pleasant experience using it during this time, so much so that I'll keep using it, and I can only recommend it to privacy-conscious netizens.

If you want to know how much Librewolf can help you regain privacy online, look at the [Privacy Tests](https://privacytests.org/) website. Also, remember to read the browser [documentation](https://librewolf.net/docs/faq/).
