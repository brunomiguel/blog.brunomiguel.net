My _Arch_/_Manjaro_ (and any other _Arch_\-based distro) repository continues to receive more packages from _[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org)_. But this post is not about that. I'm writing this because I published the scripts I'm using to build the packages for [userrepository.eu](https://userrepository.eu). You can get them at [Github](https://github.com/brunomiguel/userrepository).
