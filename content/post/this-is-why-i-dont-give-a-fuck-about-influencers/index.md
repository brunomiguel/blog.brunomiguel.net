And why I avoid a product if it's being "promoted" (advertised) by them.

An excerpt from [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/pricey-war-influence-your-instagram-feed/):

> Lotti recalls the investor saying that if she wanted Lashify to succeed, quality didn’t matter, nor did customer satisfaction—only influencers. And they didn’t come cheap. She was told to expect to shell out $50,000 to $70,000 per influencer just to make her company’s name known, an insane amount for a new startup. There was no way around it; that’s just how things worked.
