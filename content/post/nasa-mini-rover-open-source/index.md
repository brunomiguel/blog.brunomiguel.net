_NASA_'s _Jet Propulsion Laboratory_ (JPL) developed a mini version of the _Mars Curiosity Rover_, and open sourced the design and software used. The source is hosted at the agency's [_Github_ account](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover).

The project uses mostly consumer off-the-shelf parts. One of them is a _Raspberry Pi_, used as the "brain" of the rover.

From the [_Github_ repo](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover):

> JPL is always looking to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, and roboticists to help us explore and learn about our solar system (and beyond!). We release the plans for this rover as a way to try and give budding enthusiasts a fun robotics project that will help teach them and get them involved in robotics sooner and at a lower cost.

If you were looking for your next _DIY_ project, look no more.
