_Popular Science_ [published](https://www.popsci.com/why-iq-is-flawed) an article on May 2018, that I only just read, about flaws in the concept of IQ and IQ tests. The text actually presents some good arguments. From the article:

> Too many of us use the terms “IQ” and “intelligence” as if they’re interchangeable. They’re not. An IQ score isn’t a magical signifier of smarts; it merely quantifies your ability to take a particular kind of test. Wealthy, white Westerners tend to perform among the best on these exams, but that doesn’t mean they’re smarter than the rest of the world. Research increasingly indicates that the advantages that group enjoys—like better education and healthcare—set them up for success on such evaluations. And it doesn’t hurt that the most expensive education is generally geared toward improving one’s ability to fill in the proper bubbles. Access to money, school, and medicine can all change apparent acumen—but IQ ignores inherent intellect.

Well, I guess my average of 130 IQ points (don't know the [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification#Historical_IQ_classification_tables) used, however) now feel sad.
