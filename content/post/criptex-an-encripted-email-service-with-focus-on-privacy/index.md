[**_Criptex_**](https://www.criptext.com) is a new email client with a strong focus on the user's privacy and data security, released by an independent company with the same name. The app stores all the emails on the device(s) it's used, encrypted with the [_Signal Protocol_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol), instead of storing them in their servers. This gives user's total control over their data.

This software is [open source](https://github.com/Criptext) and available for _Android_, _iOS_ and _macOS_. _Linux_ and _Windows_ releases will be available soon.
