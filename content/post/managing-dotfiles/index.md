I've been looking for a simple but powerful solution for managing my _dotfiles_, either the ones on my personal computer or the ones I use on virtual machines. After taking a look at a few options, I think I'll give [dotdrop](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop) a try and publish a new post as soon as I feel I've evaluated it enough.
