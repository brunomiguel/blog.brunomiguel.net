Since my [last](https://blog.brunomiguel.net/geekices/trying-out-emacs-again/) blog post about Emacs (and the last post I published here), I've tested some Starter Kits. All of them were genuinely nice and came with a lot of tools included, but most of these tools were things I didn't need.

Not a long time after that, I found a Reddit post about [nano-emacs](https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs). Unlike the other Starter Kits, this one is plain and incredibly beautiful. It even got better recently with the addition of the `writer-mode` minor mode for `org-mode`, as you can see in the featured image on this post.

I've been using it for almost a month now, and I couldn't be happier. The only thing I think it should include by default is `markdown-mode` because, well, I write a lot in Markdown.

If you want to give Emacs a try, consider nano-emacs.
