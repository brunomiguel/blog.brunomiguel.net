With no special order:

### Desktop environments and/or window managers

- plasma (to me, the best desktop environment for any free software operating system)
- i3wm (paired with picom \[[https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom](https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom)\] for transparency, blur and rounded corners)

### Terminal emulators

- konsole (I've grown very fond if this terminal emulator since I switched to the plasma desktop, and it has blur for the blings ;))
- urxvt-unicode (with tabbedex, so I can have tabs with it)

### Text editors

- micro (my favorite and because it supports gui keybinds, although it's a cli text editor)
- nano (simple and super useful, available by default in a lot of linux distributions)
- vim (I have a custom mode for writing markdown text)
- gedit (for when I need a text editor with a gui)

### Note taking

- qownnotes

### Browsers

- firefox (my favorite for around a decade and an half. I actually used the 0.x versions)
- chromium
- brave
- falkon

### Multimedia

- gimp (and a fork named glimpse)
- darktable
- lightzone (like darktable)
- jpegoptim
- optipng
- oxipng
- youtube-dl

### System tools

- htop
- gotop
- cat
- scat (for when I need to 'cat' a file with syntax highlight)
- less
- watch (I like to keep a pane opened on tmux with the hardware temperature \[watch -n1 'sensors -A | egrep "edge|temp"'\])
- openssh
- dotdrop (for the dotfiles backup)
- tmux (I love this terminal multiplexer)
- tmuxinator (useful if you want to open tmux with any number of panes by default)
- broot (a cli file manager with vim-like keybinds and commands)
- fzf integrated with bash (because fuzzy search rocks)
- pacman (because I use [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/latest-release/), basically Arch with a graphical installer)

What about you? What are your tools of trade in a Linux system?
