In the start of July 2019, I [wrote](https://blog.brunomiguel.net/geekices/foldinghome/) about using the spare _CPU_ cycles in my _VPS_ to contribute to _Folding@home_ (_F@h_). Since then, when not building packages for _Arch Linux_, the virtual machine has been crushing numbers as a peer in this project.

Today, I've switched to [_Boinc_](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/) with the [_Rosetta@home_](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/) project. This change was due to the fact that _Boinc_ is a free software application, whereas _F@h_ is proprietary. I'm still contributing to fight _COVID-19_ (I chose the _[Rosetta@home](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/forum_thread.php?id=13702)_ project because of this), I've just changed the application I'm using.

You too can spare some of your processor idle time to fight _COVID-19_. Go to the [_Rosetta@home_ homepage](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/) to find out how.
