A few days ago I bought a _Lenovo Ideapad 320-15AST_. I had a budget of €400 and, after browsing a few stores for a couple of hours, I found this one for a bit less than €350.

At the hardware level, the computer has reasonable specs. They are (retrieved from _inxi_):

```
CPU: AMD A9-9420 dual core (1397MHz/3000MHz | boost: 3600MHz)
GPU: AMD Radeon R7 M260/M265
HDD: 1000.2GB 5400RPM
RAM: 8GB DDR4
```

This is the first time I’m buying _Lenovo_. I’ve always had a preference for _Asus_ that dates around two decades, either in laptops or in desktops and components. Also, I haven’t used _AMD_ for probably 10 years or more, but I have good memories of their _CPUs_ at the time, so let’s see how this goes. The expectations are high.

Somewhat sadly, it came with _Windows 10_ preinstalled and the store clerk said they wouldn’t refund me for the license. I wasn’t that much disappointed (although it would’ve been nice to save a few dozen euros) because this will come in hand in the situations I have to give support to computers with this _OS_ installed.

After completing the initial _Windows_ setup, I downloaded and installed [_Firefox_](https://www.mozilla.org/pt-PT/firefox/new/), proceeded to transfer [_Manjaro_](https://manjaro.org/) and wrote the _ISO_ file to a _USB_ drive. Don’t know why, but it got a kernel panic everytime I tried to boot it.

Next in line was [_Ubuntu_](https://ubuntu.com) and everything went smoothly. It’s still going. The computer has a good performance with this _OS_, even when I’m playing _Football Manager 2018_, browsing the web and listening to music on _Youtube_, all at the same time.

I do notice, however, the lack of performance of the hard drive, compared to the _SSD_ I have in the old laptop. I have to switch it soon and get a caddy.
