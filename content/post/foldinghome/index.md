A couple of days ago, I decided to use my _VPS_ spare _CPU_ cycles to help out the [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/) (F@h) project.

If you haven't heard of F@H, here is a description from their website:

> Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding, computational drug design, and other types of molecular dynamics. As of today, the project is using the idle resources of personal computers owned by volunteers from all over the world. Thousands of people contribute to the success of this project.

All you need to start contributing to this project is download the client for your _OS_ and run it. With something as simple as this you can help fight diseases.
