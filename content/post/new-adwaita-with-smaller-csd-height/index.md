I've patched the next _GTK_ theme for _Gnome_, for a screen resolution of _1366 x 768_ pixels. The changes include reducing the _CSD_ height, changing the padding on some buttons and decreasing _Gnome Terminal_ tabs height.

There are still some bugs with the theme. For example, Eye of Gnome still has a huge _CSD_ height. I'll hopefully fix this in the near future, if doable via theming.

Feel free to [clone it or fork it](https://gitlab.com/brunoalexandremiguel/new-adwaita).
